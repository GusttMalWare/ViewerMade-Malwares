# OS Compatibility
GDI malwares can run on Windows systems very well. It's recommended Windows XP or 7 for the best perfomance.
Some GDI malwares made in C# can run well on Linux, by using Wine. And it's recommended a GUI linux distro. ex: Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora or Arch.
- Some C++ GDI malwares can't run well on Linux.
For macOS, you may need to manage how to get the .exe files working. But still not recommended, I guess, as some could not run well.

# A warning!
I am not responsible for any damages happened, so good luck!
Reinstalling Windows after running a harmful malware is recommended. (Or create a snapshot before you run a malware if using virtual machine)
