# ViewerMade-Malwares
This repository contains viewer-made malwares only. PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK

# How to use the repo?
- Simply click on a folder that contains a creator name, and choose a malware, and download it
- Use the malware on a spare machine, examples: a virtual machine, spare pc or laptop.
- To extract zip/rar/7z files, you are gonna need to have a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. (Some files require a password, so I'm adding them to each password-protected files' names)

# Recommended Softwares for VM
- VMware Workstation Pro/Player - Windows and Linux
- Oracle VM VirtualBox - Windows, macOS with Intel processors and Linux
- Parallels Desktop - macOS
- VMware Fusion - macOS
- QEMU - Windows, macOS and Linux

# OS Compatibility
GDI malwares can run on Windows systems very well. It's recommended Windows XP or 7 for the best perfomance.
Some GDI malwares made in C# can run well on Linux, by using Wine. And it's recommended a GUI Linux distro. ex: Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora or Arch.
- Some C++ GDI malwares can't run well on Linux.
For macOS, you may need to manage how to get the .exe files working. But still not recommended, I guess, as some could not run well.

You might need .NET Framework 3.5 for kapi2.0peys malwares (4.0 for some) because it's made in C#.
For some malwares made in C++, you might need Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 (VC_Redist) x86 or x64 versions. I recommend both if your system is x64 and supports x86 software too.
- Because Microsoft ended support for Windows XP in 8th April 2014, Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 current versions will no longer support the OS. It will now support Windows Vista and newer versions.

# A warning!
I am not responsible for any damages happened.
Reinstalling Windows after running a harmful malware is recommended. (Or create a snapshot before you run a malware if using virtual machine)
